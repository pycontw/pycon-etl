## Release Management (CI/CD)
We use [Python CI] and [Docker Image CI] to ensure our code quality meets specific standards and that Docker images can be published automatically.

When a pull request is created, [Python CI] checks whether the code quality is satisfactory. At the same time, we build a `cache` image using `Dockerfile` and a `test` image with `Dockerfile.test`, which are then pushed to the [GCP Artifact Registry].

After a pull request is merged into the `master` branch, the two image tags mentioned above are created, along with a new `staging` tag for the image generated from `Dockerfile`.

Once we verify that the `staging` image functions correctly, we merge the `master` branch into the `prod` branch through the following commands.

<!--TODO: This is not ideal. The "master" and "prod" branches should be protected and should not allow human pushes. We should create a GitHub action for this..-->

```bash
git checkout prod
git pull origin prod

git merge origin/master

git pull origin prod
```

This triggers the [Docker Image CI] again to update the `cache`, `test`, and `staging` images, as well as to create a `latest` image that we will later use for deploying to our production instance. See the [Deployment Guide](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for the following steps.
