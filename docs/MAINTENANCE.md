# Maintenance Guide

## Disk Space

<!--TODO: we probably can make this check a dag-->

Currently, the disk space is limited, so please check the disk space before running any ETL jobs.

This section will be deprecated if we no longer encounter out-of-disk issues.

### 1. Find the largest folders:

```bash
du -a /var/lib/docker/overlay2 | sort -n -r | head -n 20
```

### 2. Show the folder size:

```bash
du -hs 
```

### 3. Delete the large folders identified.
### 4. Check disk space:

```bash
df -h
```
